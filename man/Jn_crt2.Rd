\arguments{
\item{d_est}{Effect size estimate.}

\item{d_sd}{Uncertainty in the effect size estimate.}

\item{rho_est}{Intraclass correlation estimate.}

\item{rho_sd}{Uncertainty in the intraclass correlation estimate.}

\item{r2_est}{Estimate of variance explained by the cluster-level covariates.}

\item{r2_sd}{Uncertainty in the variance explained by the cluster-level covariates.}

\item{J}{Specified number of clusters.}

\item{n}{Specified cluster size.}

\item{K}{Number of cluster-level covariates.}

\item{power}{Desired power level to achieve.}

\item{test}{One-tailed or two-tailed test.}

\item{plot}{Printing out a plot if it is TURE.}

\item{criteria}{Solve the required J or n based on the desired assurance level
or expected power}
}
\value{
The required J or n and a optionally plot that shows the power curve.
}
\description{
\code{Jn_crt2()} solves for the required number of clusters (J) or cluster size (n)
for a two-level CRT using the HCB approach. When certain uncertainty is specified,
this function determines the minimum required sample size that achieves the
desired level of expected power.
